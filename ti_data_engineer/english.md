- They are going to get married in September.
- We're out of milk. I'll go to the store.

Future actions or events can be expressed as BE + GOING TO + main verb or as WILL + main verb. "Be going to" is often used for plans, while "will" is sometimes used for decisions made at the moment.

- Zachary's going to be late if he doesn't leave now! 
- Zachary's going to France this fall.

In spoken language, future "going to" is frequently pronounced like "gonna." however, this form is not used when "going to" is the main verb itself.
